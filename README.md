# chatbox
python code for a simple chat box. Two persons in same network can chat each other with this application.
A simple chating program. user in same connections can chat with eachother. 
I used websockets, and mainly through  django channels.


Through a login system it is secured, only authorised user can get into the room and begin the chat.


I used redis, Redis is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. Redis supports different kinds of abstract data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indexes.


you need to install redis for this project to work.
